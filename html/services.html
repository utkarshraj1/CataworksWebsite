                Your content should place your clients as the heroes and you as the guide that helps them achieve their goals.
                Understanding your demographic is arguably the most important thing that you can do when keeping a blog that is designed to garner leads; 
                if you do not know your customer and write content that is irrelevant to the audience which you are attracting,
                you will fail miserably at meeting your end goal:
                more business.
